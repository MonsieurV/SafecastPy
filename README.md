## Introduction

This library provides a pure Python interface for the [Safecast API](https://api.safecast.org/).

[Safecast](http://blog.safecast.org/) provides open hardware and platforms to measure and share data about people environments. Currently the Safecast API allows to publish radiation measurement data.

As they put it:
> We believe that having more freely available open data is better for everyone.
